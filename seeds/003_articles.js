It is a data structure which together represents a sequence, Under the simplest form each node is composed of data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element references."}),
